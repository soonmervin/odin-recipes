    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Meat: This lasagna recipe starts with a pound of ground meat (half pound ground pork, Â½ pound lean ground beef).</li>
            <li>Onion: A diced onion is cooked until translucent with the ground meat.</li>
        </ol>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Step 1: Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Step 2: Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, garlic, basil, salt, oregano, and sugar. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.</li>
        </ul>
